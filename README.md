# About :arrow_upper_right:

This repository contains the front-end for our final project at Makers Academy, Pointr. It is a mobile navigation app that allows the user to drop waypoints when they go somewhere, and follow the waypoints on their way back without having to rely on textual references to their location.

The Angular front-end is compiled into a mobile app by Ionic. It sends and fetches information from the Rails API ([back-end repo](https://github.com/junyuanxue/pointr-backend)).

Here is a (sped-up) screen recording of me using the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwkhulsTFYQ&feature=youtu.be
